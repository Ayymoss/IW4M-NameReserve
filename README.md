# IW4MNameReserve - Plugin for IW4MAdmin by RaidMax.

Commands:
```
!reserve (!res) <target> 
```

Note, the configuration will only save/write when you `!quit` out of IW4MAdmin, so don't modify the config whilst IW4MAdmin is open else you will lose the changes.

Configuration is in `Configuration/ReservedClientsSettings.json`
